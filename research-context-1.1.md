# 1.1. Research Context & Problem Definition

## 1.1. Introduction
In many traditional Quran learning environments, students are expected to follow a fixed memorization schedule, which doesn't account for their unique abilities. As a result, some students may struggle to keep up, while others aren't being challenged enough. This project explores how AI can offer a more personalized approach to Quran memorization, improving learning experience for each student.

## 1.2. Aim
This project aims to propose and design a machine-learning model that provides personalized and adaptive Quran memorization plans for individual students. Using artificial intelligence, system will analyze user-specific data, such as current memorization level and student performance, to create an efficient, manageable, and flexible memorization plan. The goal is to enhance students' progress through optimized scheduling, making memorization more structured, personalized, and achievable.

## 1.3. Problem Definition

### The Challenge
Memorizing Quran is a cherished tradition in Islam, with countless Muslims dedicating themselves to this sacred pursuit. However, in today's world, memorizing Quran presents significant challenges for students. Most Quran memorization programs follow fixed schedules that do not account for individual differences in learning abilities.

### Key Issues

#### 1. Fixed Schedules Don't Work for Everyone
Students with varying memorization speeds, cognitive abilities, and learning preferences are forced to follow a standardized approach that may not suit their unique needs.

**Slow Learners:**
- Fall behind due to limited time, weaker memorization ability, or slower speed
- Become discouraged and less motivated
- Lose confidence and progress

**Fast Learners:**
- Find themselves under-challenged
- Experience disengagement and limited learning
- Not reaching their full potential

#### 2. Retention is Not Addressed
Even if students manage to memorize new material, retaining it over time requires regular revision.

**Traditional Systems Problems:**
- Fixed revision schedules don't consider individual retention capabilities
- Students forget due to inadequate review
- Students waste time on verses already mastered

#### 3. Lack of Intelligent Feedback
Teachers often rely on subjective judgment to assess progress.

**Issues:**
- No structured way to adjust plans based on performance
- Subjective and inconsistent assessments
- Students stuck in ineffective learning patterns

### The Solution Gap
There's a growing need for an intelligent system to offer a more personalized approach to Quran memorization. AI and ML technologies have the potential to transform this process by:

- Analyzing individual learning patterns
- Generating tailored memorization plans
- Assessing current level, pace, and performance
- Adjusting memorization and revision schedules dynamically
- Ensuring appropriate level of challenge and support
- Enhancing long-term retention through customized revision strategies

## 1.4. Target Users
